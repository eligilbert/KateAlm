                <p>It has taken me years to develop a method for introducing students to the Suzuki Method; it is very rewarding and well worth the investment of your time. This process educates both the parent and child thoroughly, so that when your child begins lessons, he experiences success, excellence, and joy from the very beginning. To get the best possible start in piano and ensure success for your child I require the following:</ol>
                <li>
                    <ol>Sign up to observe a private and group lesson; schedule a 30 minute consultation with me. Receive and read <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ka-public/PDFs/StudioPolicy.pdf" target="_blank">studio policy</a> and <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ka-public/PDFs/Observation.pdf" target="_blank">observation etiquette</a> handout. There is no cost for this. </ol>
                    <ol>Enroll in my 10-week Fall or Spring Suzuki Piano Immersion and Introductory Class. Book and CD included. Cost: $250.</p>
                    <ol>After you and your child have completed the Suzuki Piano Immersion and Introductory Class, you will be eligible to enroll for lessons. Enrollment is a 45 minute session in which we discuss your and your child's experience so far, (child does not attend), I answer any questions you have, and we go over the <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ka-public/PDFs/StudioPolicy.pdf" target="_blank">studio policy</a> and other handouts together. Cost: $40.</ol>
                </li>

            <div class="container-content">
                 <p>If your child is sick during the school year, please do not hesitate to cancel. This is in everyoneâ€™s best interest and the lesson can be rescheduled. Absense for other reasons is not refundable; however, you may trade times with any other student to make up for lost lessons. All of this information is included in my <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ka-public/PDFs/StudioPolicy.pdf" target="_blank">studio policy</a>.</p>
                <p>Group duos are suspended for the summer - except if you expressly request a summer duo - so that I can work with the children individually on their reading, theory, rhythm and solfa skills. Therefore in place of group duo, you receive 10 extra minutes. Sometimes I use the extra time to just chat with your child about how his summer is going. It is a very nice break from the more formalized lessons during the school year! More information about about summer is in my <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ka-public/PDFs/SummerInfo.pdf" target="_blank">summer fees and fact sheet</a>. </p>

        {#                        <p>Even after a lifetime of immersion in music, both in my childhood home, at music school, and as a professional musician such as I have had (I am happy to forward my resume on request!), being able to teach well is not guaranteed.</p>#}
{#                                <p>I am very pleased to observe, after eleven years, and more to come, of dedicated teacher-training, that my students are playing beautifully, by ear, by reading,and in ensembles. Most importantly, I am gratified to observe that their overall their experience is joyful. I hope that you and your child can be a part of this experience.</p>#}
