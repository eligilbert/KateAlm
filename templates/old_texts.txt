                <p>It has taken me years to develop a method for introducing students to the Suzuki Method; it is very rewarding and well worth the investment of your time. This process educates both the parent and child thoroughly, so that when your child begins lessons, he experiences success, excellence, and joy from the very beginning. To get the best possible start in piano and ensure success for your child I require the following:</ol>
                <li>
                    <ol>Sign up to observe a private and group lesson; schedule a 30 minute consultation with me. Receive and read <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ka-public/PDFs/StudioPolicy.pdf" target="_blank">studio policy</a> and <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ka-public/PDFs/Observation.pdf" target="_blank">observation etiquette</a> handout. There is no cost for this. </ol>
                    <ol>Enroll in my 10-week Fall or Spring Suzuki Piano Immersion and Introductory Class. Book and CD included. Cost: $250.</p>
                    <ol>After you and your child have completed the Suzuki Piano Immersion and Introductory Class, you will be eligible to enroll for lessons. Enrollment is a 45 minute session in which we discuss your and your child's experience so far, (child does not attend), I answer any questions you have, and we go over the <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ka-public/PDFs/StudioPolicy.pdf" target="_blank">studio policy</a> and other handouts together. Cost: $40.</ol>
                </li>

            <header id="banner-summer">Summer &amp School Year Policies</header>
            <div class="container-content">
                 <p>If your child is sick during the school year, please do not hesitate to cancel. This is in everyone’s best interest and the lesson can be rescheduled. Absense for other reasons is not refundable; however, you may trade times with any other student to make up for lost lessons. All of this information is included in my <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ka-public/PDFs/StudioPolicy.pdf" target="_blank">studio policy</a>.</p>
                <p>Group duos are suspended for the summer - except if you expressly request a summer duo - so that I can work with the children individually on their reading, theory, rhythm and solfa skills. Therefore in place of group duo, you receive 10 extra minutes. Sometimes I use the extra time to just chat with your child about how his summer is going. It is a very nice break from the more formalized lessons during the school year! More information about about summer is in my <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ka-public/PDFs/SummerInfo.pdf" target="_blank">summer fees and fact sheet</a>. </p>
                <p>This is an abbreviated version of summer and school year policies. For a more complete description please go to the <a href="{% url 'general:events' %}">summer</a> and <a href="{% url 'general:school_year' %}">school year</a> pages. </p>

        {#                        <p>Even after a lifetime of immersion in music, both in my childhood home, at music school, and as a professional musician such as I have had (I am happy to forward my resume on request!), being able to teach well is not guaranteed.</p>#}
{#                                <p>I am very pleased to observe, after eleven years, and more to come, of dedicated teacher-training, that my students are playing beautifully, by ear, by reading,and in ensembles. Most importantly, I am gratified to observe that their overall their experience is joyful. I hope that you and your child can be a part of this experience.</p>#}

{#                        <p><strong>September 19, 2021: </strong>I am absolutely thrilled to be raising awareness and funds for Juneteenth, Santa Cruz, and for Music in May, and to be uniting them as well- in spirit, not officially- next Spring as I collaborate with my <a href="https://youtu.be/kYmWH9fxo9c" target="_blank">Juneteenth Collective</a> to mentor and educate underserved youth in our  Harmony Choir for a concert event that will be an outreach of Music in May.#}
{#</p>#}
{#<p>I am also just beyond honored that both of the concerts are Black and BIPOC positive events: on November 21, half of performers represent BIPOC. In these times, it is a joy to note such organic relationships and to both intentionally create and to normalize such expansiveness. On April 10th, Diva Leberta Lorál richly delivers works of Black, Female, and Black Female composers.#}
{#</p>#}
{#<p>Personally, I am delighted to be continuing on my lifelong musical journey with the works of the featured composers and with my Musical Soulmates, with personal excellence at the fore while  proudly AND humbly serving Music in May and Juneteenth, Santa Cruz.#}
{#</p>#}
{#                        <p>Many of you are aware of my immersion on Gospel Music. On October 9th, I will step aside as pianist and welcome, as producer, to the Musical Soulmates stage, top of the line, world class Gospel, including our own Tammi Brown,and Oakland’s very own Terrance Kelly and his Oakland Interfaith Gospel Ensemble. I have been influenced and inspired by each of these artist, who are friends who and are sharing the stage (at the Resource Center for Nonviolence in Santa Cruz and Digitally as well) to support and raise funds for Michelle Nash. Michelle Nash is my Musical Sister, Inspiration and Friend, who can be seen singing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udyv3tDvSo4&t=180s" target="_blank">herself on my website</a>.#}
