<p>This year Kate’s Musical Soulmates series raised $1,000 for both Music in May and for Juneteenth Santa Cruz. We also supported Harmony Youth Choir. Thank you for your support! Here is a clip form last year’s program, Joy:</p>

                        <p><strong>July 16, 2022: </strong>We will announce the beneficiaries of the 2022-20223 concerts here on September 1st. Our concerts continue to be rich in representation of Black composers and BIPOC performers. Kate's Musical Soulmates series has raised thousands of dollars for Music in May, ($1,000 per year), for Juneteenth Santa Cruz, (2022) for NAACP, Santa Cruz, (2021- raised $1,500), for Hospice Santa Cruz (2020), and for Shakes-to Go (2019). Musical Soulmates series and Suzuki Piano Studio is also officially in partnership - through <a href="https://katealmsuzukipianostudio.com/harmonyyouth/">Harmony Youth Choir</a> serving and served by BIPOC.

                        <p><strong>September 19, 2021: </strong>I am absolutely thrilled to be raising awareness and funds for Juneteenth, Santa Cruz, and for Music in May, and to be uniting them as well- in spirit, not officially- next Spring as I collaborate with my <a href="https://youtu.be/kYmWH9fxo9c" target="_blank">Juneteenth Collective</a> to mentor and educate underserved youth in our  Harmony Choir for a concert event that will be an outreach of Music in May.
</p>
<p>I am also just beyond honored that both of the concerts are Black and BIPOC positive events: on November 21, half of performers represent BIPOC. In these times, it is a joy to note such organic relationships and to both intentionally create and to normalize such expansiveness. On April 10th, Diva Leberta Lorál richly delivers works of Black, Female, and Black Female composers.
</p>
<p>Personally, I am delighted to be continuing on my lifelong musical journey with the works of the featured composers and with my Musical Soulmates, with personal excellence at the fore while  proudly AND humbly serving Music in May and Juneteenth, Santa Cruz.

{#                        <p>Many of you are aware of my immersion on Gospel Music. On October 9th, I will step aside as pianist and welcome, as producer, to the Musical Soulmates stage, top of the line, world class Gospel, including our own Tammi Brown,and Oakland’s very own Terrance Kelly and his Oakland Interfaith Gospel Ensemble. I have been influenced and inspired by each of these artist, who are friends who and are sharing the stage (at the Resource Center for Nonviolence in Santa Cruz and Digitally as well) to support and raise funds for Michelle Nash. Michelle Nash is my Musical Sister, Inspiration and Friend, who can be seen singing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udyv3tDvSo4&t=180s" target="_blank">herself on my website</a>.#}

                        <p>From the proceeds of our our concerts which ran last August (our tiny stream),
                          through November 7 and December 12 -which was then postponed and combined with our 
                          February 27 concert- Musical Soulmates reached and exceeded , by 50%, our fundraising goal:
                          I had the honor of writing and sending a check of $1,500 EACH to Music in May and to NAACP 
                          Santa Cruz, and also paid all the performers and contributors. Thank you! I hope you enjoyed, continue to enjoy, or
