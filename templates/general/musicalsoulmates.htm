     I'm excited to announce the next concert of the Musical Soulmates series on Mother's Day weekend 2023!

     In addition: I am looking for Soulmates Angels to come forward and to donate $150. They will have their name listed on the next program. These “Angels" will be ensuring that while ticket prices  are now ‘pay as you can’, in an effort  to include as many new concertgoers as possible, that the Soulmates series will continue to be able to pay the artists that give this stand alone concert series its wings. The Musical Soulmates series is rich in representation of composers, performers and artists who are Black, Indigenous and People of Colo from Santa Cruz and surrounding areas.. Kate has an authentic relationship with each of the Soulmates artists. In raising funds and awareness for Music in May, Harmony Youth Choir, and Santa Cruz County Black Health Matters Initiative, she is strengthening community ties and the welfare of the BIPOC community, and is expanding the perception of Calvary Episcopal Church, as a public venue, as a space where BIPOC people are present and comfortable.
<br><br>
Tammy Lynn Hall and Leberta Lorál have recently collaborated on the stages of Grace Cathedral, the San Francisco Exploratorium, a and the mainstage at Monterey Jazz Festival and the African American Composer’s Alliance. Don’t miss this unprecedented chance to hear them in the intimate setting of Calvary Epsicopal Church, Santa Cruz .Ms.Hall and Ms. Lorál will be presenting Ellington and settings by Ms. Hall herself. Ms. Saphir Alm and Ms. Lorál will be presenting the entire “Passion”Song Cycle- a prismatic and gorgeous representation of our human passion composed by and set to words by Richard Thompson.
<br><br>
From our October 23rd concert, “Yearning”:

     <strong>November 2022</strong>I am so excited to share information about my upcoming Musical Soulmates Concert on Sunday, November 20th at 532 Center Street Santa Cruz, benefitting Music in May, Harmony Youth Choir, and Santa Cruz County Black Health Matters Initiative. ‘Passion’ features Diva Leberta Lorál supported by Kate Saphir Alm, piano AND by the illustrious Tammy Lynn Hall-Grammy TM awarded, San Francisco/Monterey based and long time contributor to Santa Cruz music, piano.
     <br><br>

     <strong>September 2022: </strong>Musical Soulmates continues presenting gorgeously intimate musical evenings, richly representing BIPOC composers and performers, and celebrating the collaborative process. In 2022-2023  we raise funds and awareness for Santa Cruz County  Black Health Matters Initiative, for Music in May, and for Harmony Youth Choir- founded by Kate Saphir Alm in collaboration with Music in May founder Rebecca Jackson-Picht, serving and served by majority BIPOC.
<br><br>
It is a delight to be starting off our 2022-2023 season with another evening of Piano Quintets. This intimate evening includes the complete and illustrious Brahms Piano Quintet, a masterpiece borne not only of Brahms' musical genius and turbulent emotions but through his collaborative journey with his own Musical Soulmates: Joseph Joachim and Clara Schumann. The evening includes selections from Ives and Grenados, which also evoke a deep yearning- perhaps personal, spiritual, or some of both. In a radical collaboration, Sarah Cruse joins us on the Ives, bringing Ives' 20th century avant-guarde sensibility into this century, overlaying the music with singing and spoken word. We present the other-wordly Allegretto quasi andantino from the Grenados Piano Quintet and reprise our favorite movement of Dvorak, from last October, the <em>Scherzo</em>, with Bhavananda Lodkey again gracing the music with poetic embodiment of a Rumi poem. We will continue the season with "Passion" on November 20, featuring Diva Leberta Lorál, supported by Kate Saphir Alm and none other than Tammy Lynn Hall, the Bay Area's renown and consummate Jazz pianist, and with "Delight", a Trio and Duets concert including the joyous Piano Trio in F Major of Saint Saëns and the Suite for Violin and Piano by William Grant Still, and more, on May 14, Mother’s Day.

Our concerts continue to be rich in representation of Black composers and BIPOC performers. Kate's Musical Soulmates series has raised thousands of dollars for Music in May, ($1,000 per year), for Juneteenth Santa Cruz, (2022) for NAACP, Santa Cruz, (2021- raised $1,500), for Hospice Santa Cruz (2020), and for Shakes-to Go (2019).

 <p><strong>September 19, 2021: </strong>I am absolutely thrilled to be raising awareness and funds for Juneteenth, Santa Cruz, and for Music in May, and to be uniting them as well- in spirit, not officially- next Spring as I collaborate with my <a href="https://youtu.be/kYmWH9fxo9c" target="_blank">Juneteenth Collective</a> to mentor and educate underserved youth in our  Harmony Choir for a concert event that will be an outreach of Music in May.
</p>
<p>I am also just beyond honored that both of the concerts are Black and BIPOC positive events: on November 21, half of performers represent BIPOC. In these times, it is a joy to note such organic relationships and to both intentionally create and to normalize such expansiveness. On April 10th, Diva Leberta Lorál richly delivers works of Black, Female, and Black Female composers.
</p>
<p>Personally, I am delighted to be continuing on my lifelong musical journey with the works of the featured composers and with my Musical Soulmates, with personal excellence at the fore while  proudly AND humbly serving Music in May and Juneteenth, Santa Cruz.
</p>


 <p><strong>March 2021: </strong>Thank you for your profoundly generous support of the Musical Soulmates concert series.</p>

                          Santa Cruz, and also paid all the performers and contributors. Thank you! I hope you enjoyed, continue to enjoy, or

{#                        <p>Many of you are aware of my immersion on Gospel Music.

I have been influenced and inspired by each of these artist, who are friends who and are sharing the stage (at the Resource Center for Nonviolence in Santa Cruz and Digitally as well) to support and raise funds for Michelle Nash.
