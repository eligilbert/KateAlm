                <h3>Comprehensive Study and Solo Studies</h3>
                <p><h4>Comprehensive study – Tuition (typically grades K-6)</h4></p>
                <p>An entire musical environment and the Suzuki Triangle (Parent-Teacher-Student) nurture, inspire, and support the young musician. Solo lessons, Group classes, All Studio Classes, Recitals, Open House, Duets, Observation, being observed, extensive home listening. (See <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ka-public/PDFs/ParentResponsibilities.pdf">Parent Responsibilities</a>). Comprehensive study is the best way to ensure success in later grades when students often switch to Solo Studies.</p>
                <p><h4>Solo Studies – Pay per season of lessons (typically grades 7-12 and Adults)</h4></p>
                <p>Pay for a season of lessons and opt-in to any studio activities as desired and as planned in concert with the parents; 24 hour cancelation is credited, (sports and other activities may become more demanding and students in 7-12 often need to reschedule). ‘Solo Studies’ supports the adolescent in taking ownership of their own learning process. ‘Solo Studies’  is optimal because it keeps them engaged with the least possible amount of requirements to be at the studio. It supports their individuation through music and allows for modest, clear goals as well as for exploration of other music and musical styles. Serves the students so that when they are motivated and inspired to take on a new musical challenge, they have the skills and resources at their fingertips, literally, to succeed. </p>

                <p><h3>Next Immersion in Fall 2022: October 3 - December 16</h3>
                <h4>Studio open for observation and registration September 19 - 30, 2022. <a href="mailto:almusic@cruzio.com">Contact Kate.</a></h4>
                <p>It has taken me years to develop a method for introducing students to the Suzuki Method; it is very rewarding and well worth the investment of your time. This process educates both the parent and child thoroughly, so that when your child begins lessons, he experiences success, excellence, and joy from the very beginning.</p>
                <p>A document with more information about what observation looks like is linked <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ka-public/PDFs/Observation.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> and below.</p>
                <p>It includes six 15 minute lessons for your child (and/or yourself) and 2 parent/teacher conferences.</p>
                <p>After you and your child have completed the 10 Week Suzuki Immersion, you will be eligible to enroll for lessons. Enrollment is a 45 minute session in which we discuss your and your child's experience so far. Please note that the child does not attend. I answer any questions you have, and we go over the <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ka-public/PDFs/StudioPolicy.pdf" target="_blank">studio policy</a>, <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ka-public/PDFs/ParentResponsibilities.pdf" target="_blank">parent responsibilities</a>, and <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ka-public/PDFs/CampusRules.pdf" target="_blank">campus rules</a> at the Peace United Church campus where I conduct lessons. I have included those documents below as well so you can take your time with them over the course of the immersion program. However, please do read them prior to our 45-minute meeting!</p>
