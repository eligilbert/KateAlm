            Musical Soulmates: Suzuki Soulmates Piano Studio, Harmony Youth Choir, and the Musical Soulmates Performer’s Collective cultivate joy, healing, and connection through both process and performance. The Musical Soulmates programs showcase a kaleidoscopic range of music and often include visual art, spoken word and poetic embodiment.
            <br><br>
            <a href="{% url 'general:immersion' %}">Musical Soulmates Suzuki Piano Studio</a> implements the philosophy of Shinichi Suzuki that develops the natural ability of every child to learn and master the art of music, and infuses love, skill, and creative engagement in music learning, nurturing the whole child. It is based on the “Suzuki Triangle” of Parent, Teacher and Child and creates an entire musical environment to nurture the child.
            <br><br>

                <li><strong>In person</strong> at the lesson is the appropriate way to discuss any concerns or questions about your child's progress or any permanent scheduling changes. If you have had problems practicing well with your child, for example, or you want to express important information about your child's needs, please mention this to me at the beginning of the lesson and we will discuss it then or at the end. In most cases, if you feel you need privacy from your child, you can simply ask your child to wait outside.</li></p>
